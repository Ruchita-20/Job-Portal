# Job Portal

## Description

This project, developed during my recent internship, is a sophisticated job portal designed to streamline the job search and recruitment process. It serves as an online platform connecting job seekers with potential employers. Employers can access and manage candidate data efficiently, search for specific candidates, and filter multiple candidates based on their requirements. The platform allows for viewing and editing profiles, mass importing and exporting data, and contacting candidates via email and WhatsApp with a single click. Additionally, it provides seamless navigation between candidates using previous and next buttons, and includes a loader to inform users that data is being fetched.
